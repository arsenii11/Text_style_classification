Thus, we usually do not\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\nWe are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance\r\nof the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.\r\nPlease be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,\r\neven years after the official publication date.\r\n\r\nPlease note neither this listing nor its contents are final til\r\nmidnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.\r\nThe official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at\r\nMidnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A\r\npreliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment\r\nand editing by those who wish to do so.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web sites at:\r\nhttps://gutenberg.org or\r\nhttp://promo.net/pg\r\n\r\nThese Web sites include award-winning information about Project\r\nGutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our new\r\neBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).\r\n\r\n\r\nThose of you who want to download any eBook before announcement\r\ncan get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is\r\nalso a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the\r\nindexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an\r\nannouncement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext05 or\r\nftp://ftp.ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext05\r\n\r\nOr /etext04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99, 98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92,\r\n91 or 90\r\n\r\nJust search by the first five letters of the filename you want,\r\nas it appears in our Newsletters.\r\n\r\n\r\nInformation about Project Gutenberg (one page)\r\n\r\nWe produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The\r\ntime it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours\r\nto get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright\r\nsearched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our\r\nprojected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value\r\nper text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2\r\nmillion dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text\r\nfiles per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+\r\nWe are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002\r\nIf they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total\r\nwill reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.\r\n\r\nThe Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!\r\nThis is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,\r\nwhich is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.\r\n\r\nHere is the briefest record of our progress (* means estimated):\r\n\r\neBooks Year Month\r\n\r\n    1  1971 July\r\n   10  1991 January\r\n  100  1994 January\r\n 1000  1997 August\r\n 1500  1998 October\r\n 2000  1999 December\r\n 2500  2000 December\r\n 3000  2001 November\r\n 4000  2001 October/November\r\n 6000  2002 December*\r\n 9000  2003 November*\r\n10000  2004 January*\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation has been created\r\nto secure a future for Project Gutenberg into the next millennium.\r\n\r\nWe need your donations more than ever!\r\n\r\nAs of February, 2002, contributions are being solicited from people\r\nand organizations in: Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Connecticut,\r\nDelaware, District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois,\r\nIndiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Massachusetts,\r\nMichigan, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New\r\nHampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Ohio,\r\nOklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South\r\nDakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, West\r\nVirginia, Wisconsin, and Wyoming.\r\n\r\nWe have filed in all 50 states now, but these are the only ones\r\nthat have responded.\r\n\r\nAs the requirements for other states are met, additions to this list\r\nwill be made and fund raising will begin in the additional states.\r\nPlease feel free to ask to check the status of your state.\r\n\r\nIn answer to various questions we have received on this:\r\n\r\nWe are constantly working on finishing the paperwork to legally\r\nrequest donations in all 50 states.

But when a long train of abuses and\nusurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to\nreduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty,\nto throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future\nsecurity.--Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such\nis now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems\nof Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a\nhistory of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object\nthe establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this,\nlet Facts be submitted to a candid world.\n\n      He has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary\n      for the public good.\n      He has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and\n      pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his\n      Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly\n      neglected to attend to them.\n      He has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large\n      districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right\n      of Representation in the Legislature, a right inestimable to them\n      and formidable to tyrants only.\n      He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual,\n      uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their Public\n      Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with\n      his measures.\n      He has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing with\n      manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people.\n      He has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, to cause\n      others to be elected; whereby the Legislative Powers, incapable of\n      Annihilation, have returned to the People at large for their\n      exercise; the State remaining in the mean time exposed to all the\n      dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within.\n      He has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States; for\n      that purpose obstructing the Laws of Naturalization of Foreigners;\n      refusing to pass others to encourage their migration hither, and\n      raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands.\n      He has obstructed the Administration of Justice, by refusing his\n      Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary Powers.\n      He has made judges dependent on his Will alone, for the tenure of\n      their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries.\n      He has erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither swarms of\n      Officers to harass our People, and eat out their substance.\n      He has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies without the\n      Consent of our legislatures.\n      He has affected to render the Military independent of and superior\n      to the Civil Power.\n      He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign\n      to our constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his\n      Assent to their Acts of pretended legislation:\n      For quartering large bodies of armed troops among us:\n      For protecting them, by a mock Trial, from Punishment for any\n      Murders which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States:\n      For cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world:\n      For imposing taxes on us without our Consent:\n      For depriving us, in many cases, of the benefits of Trial by Jury:\n      For transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offences:\n      For abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighbouring\n      Province, establishing therein an Arbitrary government, and\n      enlarging its Boundaries so as to render it at once an example and\n      fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these\n      Colonies:\n      For taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable Laws, and\n      altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments:\n      For suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring themselves\n      invested with Power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.\n      He has abdicated Government here, by declaring us out of his\n      Protection and waging War against us.\n      He has plundered our seas, ravaged our Coasts, burnt our towns, and\n      destroyed the lives of our people.\n      He is at this time transporting large armies of foreign mercenaries\n      to compleat the works of death, desolation and tyranny, already\n      begun with circumstances of Cruelty & perfidy scarcely paralleled in\n      the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy of the Head of a\n      civilized nation.\n      He has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high\n      Seas to bear Arms against their Country, to become the executioners\n      of their friends and Brethren, or to fall themselves by their Hands.\n      He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has\n      endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the\n      merciless Indian Savages, whose known rule of warfare, is an\n      undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions.\n\nIn every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress in the\nmost humble terms: Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by\nrepeated injury. A Prince, whose character is thus marked by every act\nwhich may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free People.\n\nNor have We been wanting in attention to our Brittish brethren. We have\nwarned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend\nan unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. We have reminded them of the\ncircumstances of our emigration and settlement here. We have appealed to\ntheir native justice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the\nties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations, which would\ninevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence. They too have\nbeen deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity. We must,\ntherefore, acquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our Separation, and\nhold them, as we hold the rest of mankind, Enemies in War, in Peace\nFriends.\n\nWe, therefore, the Representatives of the United States of America, in\nGeneral Congress, Assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world\nfor the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the Name, and by the Authority\nof the good People of these Colonies, solemnly publish and declare, That\nthese United Colonies are, and of Right ought to be Free and Independent\nStates; that they are Absolved from all Allegiance to the British Crown,\nand that all political connection between them and the State of Great\nBritain, is and ought to be totally dissolved; and that as Free and\nIndependent States, they have full Power to levy War, conclude Peace,\ncontract Alliances, establish Commerce, and to do all other Acts and\nThings which Independent States may of right do. And for the support of\nthis Declaration, with a firm reliance on the Protection of Divine\nProvidence, we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes and\nour sacred Honor.\n\n\n\n\n\n      Button Gwinnett\n      Lyman Hall\n      George Walton\n\n\n\n\n\n      William Hooper\n      Joseph Hewes\n      John Penn\n\n\n\n\n\n      Edward Rutledge\n      Thomas Heyward, Jr.\n      Thomas Lunch, Jr.\n      Arthur Middleton\n\n\n\n\n\n      John Hancock\n\n\n\n\n\n      Samuel Chase\n      William Paca\n      Thomas Stone\n      Charles Carroll of Carrollton\n\n\n\n\n\n      George Wythe\n      Richard Henry Lee\n      Thomas Jefferson\n      Benjamin Harrison\n      Thomas Nelson, Jr.\n      Francis Lightfoot Lee\n      Carter Braxton\n\n\n\n\n\n      Robert Morris\n      Benjamin Rush\n      Benjamin Franklin\n      John Morton\n      George Clymer\n      James Smith\n      George Taylor\n      James Wilson\n      George Ross\n\n\n\n\n\n      Caesar Rodney\n      George Read\n      Thomas McKean\n\n\n\n\n\n      William Floyd\n      Philip Livingston\n      Francis Lewis\n      Lewis Morris\n\n\n\n\n\n      Richard Stockton\n      John Witherspoon\n      Francis Hopkinson\n      John Hart\n      Abraham Clark\n\n\n\n\n\n      Josiah Bartlett\n      William Whipple\n\n\n\n\n\n      Samuel Adams\n      John Adams\n      Robert Treat Paine\n      Elbridge Gerry\n\n\n\n\n\n      Stephen Hopkins\n      William Ellery\n\n\n\n\n\n      Roger Sherman\n      Samuel Huntington\n      William Williams\n      Oliver Wolcott\n\n\n\n\n\n      Matthew Thornton\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA ***\n\n\n    \n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one—the old editions will\nbe renamed.\n\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United\nStates without permission and without paying copyright\nroyalties.

Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state\nvisit www.gutenberg.org/donate.\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.

General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\nGutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\ndistributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of\nvolunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\nedition.\n\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org.\n\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n\n",

We recognize that all peoples of the\nworld have the right to live in peace, free from fear and want.\n\n     We believe that no nation is responsible to itself alone,\nbut that laws of political morality are universal; and that\nobedience to such laws is incumbent upon all nations who would\nsustain their own sovereignty and justify their sovereign\nrelationship with other nations.\n\n     We, the Japanese people, pledge our national honor to\naccomplish these high ideals and purposes with all our resources.\n\n\n\n                     CHAPTER I.

U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.\n\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\nGutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\ndistributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of\nvolunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\nedition.\n\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org.\n\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n\n"
